# Phase 8 — Quality & release

- **P8.1 Test suite consolidation** — unit tests for listing, sorting,
  selection and operations modules run in CI-friendly fashion
  (`dotnet test`). *Done when:* green test run covers core logic.
- **P8.2 Cross-platform verification** — manual checklist on Windows and
  Linux (paths, drives, permissions, terminal quirks). *Done when:*
  checklist documented in `_documentation/` and passing.
- **P8.3 Packaging** — publish profiles for self-contained single-file
  builds per OS. *Done when:* `dotnet publish` produces a runnable binary.
