# Phase 6 — Viewing files

Goal: quick inspection without leaving the manager.

- **P6.1 F3 view** — read-only viewer for the file under the cursor
  (text, scrollable); binary files fall back to a hex-ish/raw view.
  *Done when:* viewer opens and closes with `F3`/`Esc`.
- **P6.2 F4 edit** — launch the system editor (`$EDITOR` / notepad) for the
  cursor file, suspending the TUI; refresh on return. *Done when:* editing
  round-trips cleanly.
