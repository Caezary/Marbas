# Phase 1 — Application skeleton

Goal: an empty but working full-screen TUI application.

- **P1.1 Bootstrap Terminal.Gui** — `Application.Init`, a top-level window,
  clean shutdown. *Done when:* app starts full-screen and exits with `Ctrl+Q`.
- **P1.2 Two-panel layout** — two framed sub-views split 50/50 horizontally,
  resizing with the terminal. *Done when:* both panels are visible and resize
  correctly.
- **P1.3 Panel focus switching** — `Tab` moves focus between panels; the
  focused panel is visually distinct. *Done when:* focus toggles with `Tab`.
- **P1.4 Function-key bar** — bottom bar listing key actions
  (`F5 Copy … F8 Delete F10 Quit`), initially inert except `F10` = quit.
  *Done when:* the bar renders and `F10` exits.
